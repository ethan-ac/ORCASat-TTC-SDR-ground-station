# summary of this blocks purpose that will appear in the documentation tab of its properties
documentation: |-
    This block delays the data stream by a number of samples (based on the desired time delay in milliseconds and the samples per second of the flowgraph). It will also determine the amount of time the packet will take the transmit and send that value to the keyer block.

# dont allow there to be < 1 ports, so minimum # inputs/outputs is 1
asserts:
- ${ num_ports > 0 }
- ${ vlen > 0 }

#  'file_format' specifies the version of the GRC yml format used in the file
#  and should usually not be changed.
